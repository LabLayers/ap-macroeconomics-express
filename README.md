# Introduction

## AP Macroeconomics Express

Accelerated version of the full-year “Advanced PlacementⓇ Macroeconomics” class, taught in one semester. Focuses less on context/history and more on the content tested on the AP exam. The format of this class allows me to write most notes in markdown and publish them online.

If you find any inaccuracies or unclear content, please send me a pull request on GitHub as this is an open-source project. Enjoy! :wink:
