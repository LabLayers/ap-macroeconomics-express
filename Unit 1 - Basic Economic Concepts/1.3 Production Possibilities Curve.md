# 1.3 Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)

**Words** lead to **Numbers** which helps us create **Graphs** leading us to **Generalizations**.

- Graph & chart model showing alternative ways to show scarce resources.
- 4 Key Assumptions: only 2 goods, full employment, fixed resources, and fixed technology.
- Demonstrates scarcity, trade-offs, opportunity costs, and efficiency (possible free response question)
- Each point represents a specific combination of goods that can be produced given full employment of resources.

Here's an example showing **Increasing Opportunity Cost** (notice the curve) and the different production possibilities within a curve:

- Outside curve = Unattainable because of scarcity
- On curve = Most efficient use of resources and full employment
- Inside curve = Inefficient use of resources and unemployment

| Item | A | B | C | D | E |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| :bike: Bike | 14 | 12 | 9 | 5 | 0 |
| :computer: Computer | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 |

Here's another example showing **Constant Opportunity Cost** (notice the straight line):
