# 1.2 Economic Systems

There are a bunch of economic systems out there, the most common (and superior) being regulated capitalism! Sorry, North Korea. :us::us::us:

## 3 Economic Questions

To determine the type of economic system:

1. **What** goods and services should be produced? :fried_shrimp:
2. **How** should these goods and services be produced? :ocean::zap:
3. **Who** consumes goods and services? :neckbeard:


## Types of Economic Systems

1. Centrally Planned Economy
2. Free Market Economy
3. Mixed Economy

## Centrally Planned - Communism/Marxism
1. Govenrment owns all the resources.
2. Answers all 3 economic questions.

Examples: Cuba, North Korea, Former USSR, China (not really but they're doing a great job pretending!)

- Face economic shortages, poor quality foods, unhappy citizens.
- Lack of incentive to work harder.
- Lack of mobility.
- Not maximizing potential of its citizens.
- Low economic output.
- Bottom of GDP lists.
- Hard time predicting preferences.
- More popular in poorer countries. (Mentality: a little bit of something is better than nothing at all, especially when it come to basic needs.)

## Free Market - Capitalism

1. Little governmet involvement in economy - Lassiez Faire
2. Individual owns resources
3. The opportunity to make **profit** gives people **incentive** to produce items efficently
4. Wide variety of goods available
5. Competition and self-interest work to **regulate**

## Example of Free Market

USA! USA! USA! (Most of the other countries too but USA is clearly superior! :wink:)

- Smartphones & data plans
- Lower prices, better quality, more product variety
- Resources follow profits
