# 1.1 Introduction to Economics

## Economics

- Study of **scarcity** and **choice**
- Microeconomics - small economic units
- Macroeconomics - economy as a whole
- **Theoretical Economics** -  economic applications of the scientific method
  - **Policy Economics** -  theories applied to meet goals
- Positive Facts - *“what is”*
- Normative Opinions - *“what ought to be”*

## 5 Key Economic Assumptions
1. Unlimited wants and limited needs: **scarcity**
2. Due to scarcity, choices must be made: **trade-off**
3. Everyone's goal is to make satisfactory choices: **self-interest**
4. **Marginal costs** & **marginal benefits**.
5. There's always limited resources.

## Marginal Analysis

Marginal = Additional

You are making decisions based on increments. At some point happiness is complete and a good or service becomes less valuable - like pizza or movies! See below:

| # of Slices | Mood |
| -- | -- |
| 0 | I'm starving (demand) |
| 1 | Nom nom, half-full, need another slice |
| 2 | I think I'm full |
| 3 | Totally Stuffed |
| 4 | You're gonna have to pay me |
| 5 | You're gonna have to pay me well! |

| # of times seeing movie | Value to you | Ticket cost |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | $30 | $10 |
| 2 | $15 | $10 |
| 3 | $5 | $10 |
