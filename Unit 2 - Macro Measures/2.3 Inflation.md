# 2.3 Inflation

The third goal of an economic system is to limit inflation. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

[Inflation in Zimbabwe reached as 79,600,000,000% in November 2008. Their currency lost nearly half of its value in a given 24 hour period.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe)

## Effects of inflation

- Inflation causes less purchasing power for money
- 4% is the US standard inflation rate
- Rapid inflation is bad
- Doesn't effect everyone equally!

## During periods of rapid inflation...
- Banks don't lend n' :moneybag:
- People don't spend so :money_with_wings:
- It decreases investment in GDP. :cry

## Key Terms
- **Deflation** rarely happens. People tend to hoard money.
- **Disinflation** is when prices go at a slower rate.

## Who does inflation hurt?
- Lenders (with their fixed interest rate)
- Fixed income people (disabilities, social security, etc)
- Savers

## Who does inflation help?
- Borrowers
- Businesses where price of product increases faster than price of resources

## Nominal vs Real Wage

Self explanatory... nominal wages are numbers specific point in time, and real wage are numbers adjusted for inflation.

## Two ways to measure inflation
1. Inflation rate = year to year growth
2. Price indices = growth relative to base year (see Consumer Price Index)

## Consumer Price Index
Measures changes in the price level of a **market basket** containing goods and services purchased by households. This does not account for substitution, demand, new products, or quality!

Here's the formula:
