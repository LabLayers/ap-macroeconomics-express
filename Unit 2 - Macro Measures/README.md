# Unit 2 - Macro Measures

- Macroeconomics is a study of the economy as a whole
- Started during the Great Depression when the government did not know how to fix 25% unemployment
- The idea that "market fixes itself" is not true because because people have to survive
  - One way to fix this... Spend money to build demand to save the economy for countries like Germany and Italy during WWII

## 3 goals of an economic system

1. Promote economic growth (Boost **GDP**)
2. Limit **unemployment**
3. Keep prices stable (Limit **inflation**)
